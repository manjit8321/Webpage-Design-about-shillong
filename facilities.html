    <p1>Although well connected by road, Shillong has neither rail connections nor a proper air connection. Umroi Airport located 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the city centre has only limited flights. Recently regular flights have been made available for Shillong to Kolkata from July 2019.</p1>

            Sub-district or Sub-divisional hospitals (SDHs) are below the district and above the block level (Community Health Centres) hospitals and also act as First Referral Units with bed strength ranging from 31 to 100. Specialist services are provided through these sub-district hospitals. These hospitals should play an important referral link between the Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres and sub-centres.</p2>

            <p3><br>District hospitals (DHs) with bed strengths ranging from 100 plus to 500 are an essential component of the district health system and function as a secondary level of health care which provides curative, preventive and promotive healthcare services to the people in the district. Every district is expected to have a district hospital linked with the public hospitals or health centres down below the district such as Sub-district or Sub-divisional hospitals, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres and Sub-centres.</br></p3>

    <p4><br>State hospitals (SHs) with bed strengths ranging from 100 plus to 500 are an independent entity and provide specific services like Ganesh Das Mother and Child Hospital in Shillong, Reid Provincial Chest Hospital in Shillong and TB Hospital at Tura. They report directly to the state directorate and are autonomous in function.</br></p4>
